# Practical Machine Learning Project
## Human Activity Recognition - Weight Lifting Exercise

### Background
Using devices such as *Jawbone Up*, *Nike FuelBand*, and *Fitbit* is now possible to collect a large amount of data about personal activity relatively inexpensively. These type of devices are part of the quantified self movement â€“ a group of enthusiasts who take measurements about themselves regularly to improve their health, to find patterns in their behavior, or because they are tech geeks. One thing that people regularly do is quantify how *much* of a particular activity they do, but they rarely quantify how *well* they do it.

### Goal
In this project the goal is to develop a model to predict the manner in which they did the exercise, based on data from three-axis gyro sensors on the belt, forearm, arm, and dumbell.

The measured workout was performed by six male participants who were asked to perform one set of 10 repetitions of the Unilateral Dumbbell Biceps Curl in five different fashions:

- exactly according to the specification (Class A)
- throwing the elbows to the front (Class B)
- lifting the dumbbell only halfway (Class C)
- lowering the dumbbell only halfway (Class D)
- throwing the hips to the front (Class E).

Class A corresponds to the specified execution of the exercise, while the other 4 classes correspond to common mistakes.
